## Project Details

I have created an application (for this event needs I am using .NET/Blazor) which will allow me to see instantly if person I am looking will be available soon - and if someone will be available I will show the time slots when there is possibility to reach out with option to quick message on teams/e-mail with some simple message.

### Purpose
Nowadays I am usually checking folks calendars and I am trying to see when they will be able to talk with me. It is usually time consuming. I just wanted to have compact overview of my week and also ability to quickly check availability of my colleges.

### Branching strategy
There is standard git flow implemented with `RELEASE` (will be created for first release), `MASTER`, `DEVELOPEMENT` and `FEATURE` branches. 

### Future plans
My plan after this hack is to incorporate this feature to the MS Teams in the end to actually use it on daily basis.
